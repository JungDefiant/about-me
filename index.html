      <p>
        I'm Ashley (she/her). I've been working in education since 2009, teaching general music and beginning band. I'm a music and arts nerd by trade and enjoy using technology to enhance artistic creativity. Increasingly, I am becoming interested in creating these tools. After talking with more people in the tech industry, I feel like it could be a good fit for me professionally. I'm excited to exercise my mind with a new challenge and, eventually, find passion in a software development career.
